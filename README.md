#Tank Battle: Iron Warfare

This project contains the full source code for the 3D action combat iPhone game "Tank Battle: Iron Warefare", released by its sole author (John Judnich) as open-source with The MIT Licence.

The included media files consist of a combination of custom made artwork and public domain images/sounds. For example, all the maps and tanks were created by the author of this project (and of course are also released under the same open source license).

##About

This project was created from scratch in about four months, with no prior knowledge of iOS development or Objective-C. Although much of the code is somewhat tidy (though I would implement most things quite differently, looking back), other areas were rushed (for example, the menus and AI code should be refactored).

Overall this was a reall enjoyable project. Since everything was made from scratch, I learned a lot implementing: 3D art pipeline & converter tools, 3D math functions, image loaders, resource management, 3D engine framework, a custom script parser used to load all the game objects, high performance terrain renderer, tree renderer, pooled and batched particle systems, etc. etc.
