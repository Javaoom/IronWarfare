#Tank Battle: Iron Warfare

This project contains the full source code for the 3D action combat iPhone game "Tank Battle: Iron Warefare", release by its sole author (John Judnich) as open-source with The MIT Licence.

The included media files consist of a combination of public domain images/sounds from the internet, and custom made artwork. In particular, all the maps and tanks were created by the author of this project, and are also released under the same open-source license.

##About

This project was created in a rush, taking about four months total work to complete from scratch with no prior knowledge of iOS development or Objective-C. Everything is done in a mix of C (for performance) and Objective-C. Much of the code is somewhat tidy (though I would implement most things quite differently, looking back), while other areas were rushed and are a mess (the menus and AI in particular).

Overall this was a really great, fun project. I learned a lot about what goes into a full game as everything was made from scratch: 3D art pipeline & converter tools, 3D math functions, image loaders, resource management, 3D engine framework, a custom script parser used to load all the game objects, high performance terrain renderer, tree renderer, pooled and batched particle systems, etc. etc.
